### Code
We used Matlab R2016b with the statistics toolbox. To reproduce the figures in the manuscript, start matlab, navigate to the repository-folder and add it to the matlabpath:

```
cd('/Path/to/this/repo');
addpath(pwd);
```

Then call one of these scripts or functions: 

- `plot_figures.m`: gives an overview of all functions. Run each code block separately to reproduce the respective figure from the paper.
- `plot_*.m`: all functions with this prefix in plot_figures.m do the actual plotting.
- `create_*.m`: all functions with this prefix in plot_figures.m show how the statistics for the respective subfigure was computed.
